# Toy-Problems
All toy problems I have worked on with different approaches over the years:

### Aproaches:
~ Sliding Window - creating a "window" and moving it across an array or object <br />
~ Frequency Counter - Count how many times 'X' appears <br />
~ Multiple Pointers - Using pointers for comparison

### Recurision
~ Helper function - Helper function recursion <br />
~ Recursive Function - Single function invoking itself
